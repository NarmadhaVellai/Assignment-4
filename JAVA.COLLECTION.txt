ArrayList are dynamic size arrays. Try this problem using ArrayList.

Given a ArrayList of N elements and a integer Q defining the type of query(which will be either 1 or 2) :
Q = 1 includes two integers p and r. Which means insert the value r at index p in the ArrayList and print the whole updated ArrayList.
Q = 2 includes one integer p. In this query print the index at which the value p is last found in the ArrayList. If the value p is not found in the ArrayList then print "-1". 

NOTE: Assume 0 based indexing

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5, Q = 1 
A[] = {1, 4, 5, 9, 3} 
Query[] = {2, 6} 
Output: 
1 4 6 5 9 3 
Explanation: 
p=Query[0]=2 
r=Query[1]=6 
After inserting the element 
r=6 at index p=2 ,the updated 
arraylist ={1,4,6,5,9,3}
 

Example 2:

Input:
N = 4 , Q = 2
A[]= {1, 9, 2, 4}
Query[]= {4}
Output:
3 
Explanation: 
p = 4 
The element 4 is last found
in A at index = 3   
 

Your Task: 
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function solve() which takes the N (number of elements in Array A) ,ArrayList A, Q(Type of the of query) and the ArrayList Query. If the Q = 1 then return the updated ArrayList of integers. else return the ArrayList which contains the index at which the value p is last found in the ArrayList A (where p = Query[0] ) ,If the value of p is not found then return the ArrayList which contains -1. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 104
1 <= Q <= 2
If Q = 1 then size of Query is 2 ,
where Query[0] represents the value of p and Query[0] represents the value of r.
If Q = 2 then size of Query is 1 ,
where Query[0] represents the value of p.
1 <= A[i] <= 103




ANSWERS:


class Solution 
{ 
    ArrayList<Integer> solve(int N, ArrayList<Integer> A, int Q, ArrayList<Integer> Query) 
    { 
        // code here
        ArrayList<Integer>res=new ArrayList<>();
        if(Q==1)
        {
            int p=Query.get(0);
            int r=Query.get(1);
            A.add(p,r);
            return A;
        }
        else
        res.add(A.lastIndexOf(Query.get(0)));
        return res;
    }
}
